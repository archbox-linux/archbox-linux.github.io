ArchBox is elegantly looking ready to use desktop on LiveCD (with ability to install on HDD) based on Arch Linux featured with Openbox and lots of preinstalled programs.

ArchBox was inspired by [ArchBang](http://wiki.archbang.org/) and with big love to [Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org/).

ArchBox means **Arch Linux + Openbox** and at the same time **Arch Linux out of the box**
