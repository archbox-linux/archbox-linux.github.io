{"name":"ArchBox Linux","tagline":"","body":"#ArchBox\r\n\r\nArchBox means Arch Linux + Openbox\r\n\r\nThis project contains [archiso](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/archiso) profile to build ready-to-use iso with [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) and preconfigured [Openbox](http://openbox.org) window manager.\r\n\r\nFor now it is just a live media. In plans - with ability to install.\r\n\r\n##Build iso\r\n\r\n###Prerequisites:\r\nArch Linux (x64_86), installed archiso, packages from base-devel group (?), yaourt (link here)\r\n\r\n1. Clone this git repo \r\n    (TODO: insert git command here)\r\n\r\n2. Change dir to ./scripts/\r\n\r\n3. run build-customrepo.sh (as normal user)\r\n    this will build all packages from AUR needed to include to iso (listed in packages-aur.lst) and add repo record to pacman.conf\r\n    Hint: may need to enter root password for sudo\r\n    Warning! This needs to build it in a clean chroot (TODO: link here to archwiki about building in chroot) so will take quite a lot of disk space (~4Gb).\r\n\r\n4. run prepare-build.sh\r\n    this change owner of profile dir to root and clean up work dir in case of iso rebuild\r\n\r\n5. cd to \"./archbox\" and run \"./build.sh -v\" as root\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
